# Utility function to read the README file.
# Used for the long_description.  It's nice, because now 1) we have a top level
# README file and 2) it's easier to type in the README file than to put a raw
# string in below ...
# def read(fname):
#     return open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), fname)).read()
